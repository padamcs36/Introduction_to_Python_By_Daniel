'''
The slicing operatorreturns a slice of the string using the syntax s[start : end].
The slice is a substring from index start to index end â€“ 1.
If index (i or j) in the slice operation s[i : j] is negative,
replace the index with len(s) + index. If j > len(s), j is set to len(s).
If i >= j, the slice is empty
